Global tags can still be used with custom link buttons to pre-filter specific pages, e.g. \"#filter:tagname\".\n\n**Color tags** use parentheses to customize tag appearance: \"tagname(#fc1808)\" sets the background color, while \"tagname(#bg #text #hover)\" sets the background, text, and hover/selected colors. Color syntax can be combined with global tags, e.g. \"!tagname(#fc1808)\".\n\n**Character tags** added in Plans modals indicate which characters are involved in certain events or arcs."
