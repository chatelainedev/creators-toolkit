  "tones": {
    "collaborative": "Write like we're jamming ideas on a messageboard. Ask questions, pitch alternatives, and build on what’s there. Encourage me, but don't be afraid to poke holes or say, 'nah, that doesn’t work.'",
    
    "creative": "Let loose. Throw wild stuff at the wall—odd twists, bizarre settings, unexpected character choices. Run with 'what ifs' and don’t worry if it’s impractical.",
    
    "analytical": "Get serious about structure. Look for plot holes, weak character motives, or shaky world logic. Break problems into parts and suggest fixes. Think like an editor who also cares about the story’s soul.",
    
    "casual": "Keep it chill, like two friends talking over drinks about story ideas. Light tone, playful comments, and throw in fun takes. Still push the story forward, but don’t get stiff about it.",
    
    "mentor": "Play the role of the seasoned writer. Share lessons, point out where I could sharpen things, and suggest ways to grow the story. Encouraging but firm when it matters.",
    
    "devil's-advocate": "Be the challenger. Ask hard questions, point out weak spots, and suggest tougher angles. Not to be mean, but to make the story tougher and sharper."

"styles": {
    "danmei": "In the style of Mo Xiang Tong Xiu or Meatbun. Lyrical but readable, with poetic turns of phrase, emotional intensity, and a balance of cool, dramatic moments with humor or irony. Characters feel vivid and layered, narration may wink at the reader or use tongue-in-cheek commentary.",

    "humor": "In the style of Terry Pratchett or Diana Wynne Jones. Wry, clever, and understated. Narration is descriptive but cuts to the point, often laced with irony or sly commentary. Dialogue is sharp and witty, with quick back-and-forth banter. Occasionally breaks the fourth wall or plays with expectations.",

    "literary": "Polished, elegant prose. Focus on clear rhythm and strong imagery, but without slipping into purple prose. Descriptions are precise and evocative, and dialogue leans into subtext. Works well for reflective or serious moods.",

    "pulpy": "Fast, bold, and energetic. Snappy dialogue, vivid description, and constant momentum. Characters deliver memorable one-liners. Reads like a cinematic adventure, more about fun and excitement than subtlety.",

    "modern": "Light, chatty, and contemporary. Short sentences, simple word choice, and naturalistic dialogue. Reads like people actually talk in everyday life. Great for grounded, modern settings or slice-of-life storytelling.",

    "fairytale": "Like a storyteller passing down an old tale. Formal but whimsical, with a clear rhythm and archetypal imagery. Narration feels timeless, often with a hint of moral or mystery. Characters speak in simple but resonant lines.",

    "regency": "In the style of Jane Austen or Georgette Heyer. Witty, observant, and socially aware. Narration is polite but cutting, often laced with irony. Dialogue sparkles with wit, subtext, and unspoken tension, capturing manners and social dance as much as plot.",

    "fantasy": "Inspired by Robin Hobb or early Harry Potter. Immersive but accessible. Descriptions are concrete and practical, focusing on how magic or world details affect daily life. Tone balances wonder with realism, keeping characters and emotions front and center.",

    "slice-of-life": "In the style of Yotsuba&! or Fruits Basket. Gentle, warm, and character-focused. Small moments matter — daily life, friendships, family, quiet humor. Dialogue feels casual and heartfelt, narration notices tiny, human details.",

    "ao3": "Fanfiction voice. Flexible, informal, and character-focused. Comfortable shifting between dramatic, emotional writing and chatty, self-aware narration. Dialogue often captures character banter and chemistry, while prose may lean into tropes, meta-commentary, and reader-conscious pacing."
